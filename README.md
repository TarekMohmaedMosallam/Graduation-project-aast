 PlantsyInc Helper - Graduation Project
Description:
PlantsyInc Helper is my graduation project, which aims to revolutionize wheat farming by detecting whether wheat plants are healthy or sick. The project combines advanced machine learning models with soil measurement data to give farmers actionable insights for better crop management.

🎯 Purpose
Detect the health status of wheat plants using an AI model.
Analyze soil measurements to enhance prediction accuracy.
Could you assist farmers in identifying issues early to improve yield and sustainability?
🚀 Features
AI-based health detection for wheat plants.
Integration with soil measurement sensors for enhanced insights.
Mobile application interface for easy data input and result visualization.
Real-time alerts and suggestions for soil and crop management.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Flutter: For building the mobile application interface.
Firebase: For real-time database and user authentication.
Python: For developing machine learning models and integrating AI algorithms.
